Hello and welcome to my new blog, built with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>.
I hope to treat this blog as a development journal, documenting any cool projects I am working on, tutorials, etc.
I also think having a place like this, where I can work with any type of technology and share my findings, is a
great way for me (and possibly you) to experience software and tools I might not work with on a day to day basis.

But that is enough of that, it's late so time for bed.

Hope you like it,
Cheers.
