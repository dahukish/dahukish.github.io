Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” Iâ€™m **Stephen Hukish**, a senior front-end engineer with full-stack chops and a passion for building high-impact tools, elegant interfaces, and now, intelligent systems powered by AI.

Over the last 15+ years, Iâ€™ve worked with companies ranging from small dev studios to major players like **Shopify** and **Scotiabank**, shipping scalable products across commerce, banking, and internal platforms.

### What I Build

- âœ¨ **Interfaces that scale**: From internal dashboards to global storefronts, I craft fast, accessible front-ends using React, TypeScript, and modern frameworks.
- ðŸ§  **AI-infused features**: At Shopify, I worked on **Sidekick**, integrating LLMs (OpenAI/Anthropic) into merchant tools for smarter commerce.
- ðŸ§° **Full-stack solutions**: Iâ€™ve built APIs and backend tools in Ruby on Rails and Node.js, with a focus on developer experience and maintainability.
- ðŸš€ **Platform upgrades**: I love solving big foundational problems â€” things like Webpack migrations, Apollo upgrades, DX tooling, and CI pipelines.

### Why This Blog Exists

Iâ€™m using this space to:

- Share side projects and experimental tools.
- Write dev notes on AI integrations, front-end performance, or cool tech.
- Reflect on lessons from big projects and transitions (like being let go from Shopify â€” yep, it happens).

### Letâ€™s Connect

If youâ€™re building something ambitious (especially in the AI, devtools, or UX space) â€” Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
