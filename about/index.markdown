title: About Me
---

Hello, my name is Stephen and I am a geek, albeit a professional one.

Now, before you navigate away from my site let me explain what I mean by this.
A geek by definition is “an enthusiast or expert especially in a technological field or activity <computer geek>”.
This is an accurate description of me and what I love to do;
I am passionate about software development (web or otherwise) and design.

Ever since I was little, I have had an insatiable curiosity with computers and the programs that they ran,
which ultimately led to me to choosing the career path of a web developer.
It is a path that has bought me many opportunities to showcase my talent on both a national and international scale.
I have launched this blog to show a little of my work and my interest in web and interactive digital medium as well as my print work.
I will be continually adding work, as well as other interesting elements to my site, so check back often to see what’s new.

Sincerely,

Stephen Hukish
